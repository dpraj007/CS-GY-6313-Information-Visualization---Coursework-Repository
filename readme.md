# CS-GY 6313: Information Visualization - Coursework Repository

This repository contains the coursework completed for **CS-GY 6313: Information Visualization** at New York University. The projects in this repository explore various data visualization techniques and tools, with a focus on creating interactive and insightful visualizations.

## Course Overview

CS-GY 6313: Information Visualization delves into the principles and practices of effectively visualizing data. The course covers topics such as:

*   Data representation and visual encoding
*   Interaction design for visualization
*   Visualization techniques for different data types (e.g., temporal, geospatial, network)
*   Evaluation of visualization effectiveness
*   Tools and libraries for creating visualizations (e.g., D3.js, Python visualization libraries)

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by assignment, showcasing the progression of skills and concepts learned throughout the course. Here's a brief overview:

*   **Assignment_1:** This assignment focuses on exploratory data analysis and basic visualization techniques using Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. The code for this assignment can be found in the Jupyter Notebook:
```
Assignment_1/INFO_VIS.ipynb
startLine: 1
endLine: 1571
```
*   **Assignment_4:** This assignment involves creating an interactive web application that advocates for higher education by visualizing the impact of educational attainment on economic factors. It includes two versions:
    *   **Education_advocacy_app_v1:** This version uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with D3.js for visualization. The `readme.md` file provides details on running the application locally:
    ```
    Assignment_4/Education_advocacy_app_v1/readme.md
    startLine: 1
    endLine: 155
    ```
    *   **Education_advocacy_app_v2:** This version is built using React with Vite and utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling. The `readme.md` file explains how to install dependencies and run the application:
    ```
    Assignment_4/submission_iv_04/Education_advocacy_app_v2/readme.md
    startLine: 1
    endLine: 85
    ```
*   **FInal_project:** This folder contains data related to the final project, including a Jupyter Notebook for downloading Google Scholar data.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

The projects in this repository demonstrate a range of information visualization concepts, including:

*   **Data Wrangling and Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for visualization.
*   **Visual Encoding:** Choosing appropriate visual channels (e.g., position, size, color) to represent data attributes.
*   **Interactivity:** Implementing user interactions (e.g., hover, click, zoom) to enable data exploration.
*   **Chart Types:** Utilizing various chart types (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, radar charts) to effectively communicate insights.
*   **Web-Based Visualization:** Building interactive visualizations for the web using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and libraries like D3.js and React.

## Tools and Technologies

The following tools and technologies were used in the development of these projects:

*   **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
*   **Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `geopandas`, `D3.js`, `React`, `lucide-react`
*   **Frameworks:** `Vite`, `Tailwind CSS`
*   **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, npm/yarn
